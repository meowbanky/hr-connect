## 📖 The Story

Hiring is usually a fragmented mess.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmeowbanky%2Fhr-connect)] Candidates jump through hoops, HR teams drown in spreadsheets, and data is scattered across five different "dashboards."[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmeowbanky%2Fhr-connect)]

**HR Connect** was built to solve the fragmentation problem.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmeowbanky%2Fhr-connect)] It isn't just a recruitment tool; it's a **Connection Engine.** It bridges the gap between high-potential talent and data-driven HR leadership by unifying the entire lifecycle—from the first click on a job board to the final onboarding checklist—into one clean, high-performance interface.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmeowbanky%2Fhr-connect)]
